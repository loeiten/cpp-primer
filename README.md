## Issues with setting up Visual studio code

- Problem: `python` pointing at `/usr/bin/python`
- Solution: The `conda` way of exporting the path in `.zshrc` may not work. Add the [following](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55043991/2786884) to the user settings

   ```json
   "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "PATH": ""
   }
   ```

- Problem: The symbols are missing from the powerline
- Solution: Use [`nerd-font`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/#option-3-install-script) as explained [here](https://gist.github.com/480/3b41f449686a089f34edb45d00672f28)

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

and add

```
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Hack Nerd Font"
```

to `settings.json` (<kbd>CMDâŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> -> `Open Settings (JSON)`)

- Problem: Need to save manually
- Solution: `File` -> `Auto save`
